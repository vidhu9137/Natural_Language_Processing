Using nltk libraries found out Semantic Similarity between two text paragraphs.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**
Dataset (attached with the task): The data contains a pair of paragraphs. These text paragraphs are randomly sampled from a raw dataset. Each pair of sentences may or 
may not be semantically similar. The task is to predict a value between 0-1 indicating the similarity between the pair of text paras. 
A sample of a similar dataset will be used as test data, therefore itâ€™s crucial to the model solution using provided dataset.

**PROCEDURE FOLLOWED**
Builded an algorithm, using nltk libraries, that can quantify the degree of similarity between the two text-based on Semantic similarity. 
Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) assesses the degree to which two sentences are semantically equivalent to each other.
1 means highly similar
0 means highly dissimilar
